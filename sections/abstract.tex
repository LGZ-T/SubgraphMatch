Subgraph matching finds all subgraphs of a data graph that are isomorphic to a query graph. It is a fundamental operation in many application fields like analysis of protein-protein interaction network and community detection. Existing works adopt a simple matching procedure that matches vertices of a query graph one by one, which incurs a large number of memory accesses during reading and writing intermediate results. In this work, we propose a double-vertex extension method that can match at most two query vertices at each iteration and generate corresponding results in one GPU kernel. Compared to GSI, which is the state-of-the-art GPU-based subgraph matching method, our approach achieves an average speedup of $5\times$. Additionally, we optimize the data graph format of GSI by replacing its hash indexes with interval indexes. The proposed interval-index format reduces the space cost and searching time of hash-index format by 83\% and 58\% respectively. To validate the effectiveness of double-vertex extension method, we also compare it to the single-vertex extension method devised based on our double-vertex extension method. Results show that our approach improves the single-vertex extension method by 15.9\% on average.

%Based on properties of the data graph, there are many types of subgraph matching. In this work, we focus on matching query graphs on a labeled undirected data graph with the acceleration of GPU.
