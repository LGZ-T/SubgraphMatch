\section{Conclusions}
We have presented \SystemName, a GPU-based parallel vertex matching scheme for performing subgraph search in a labeled undirected data
graph. \SystemName is designed to match multiple vertices within a single GPU kernel to reduce the GPU memory accesses. It implements a new
vertex storage format to reduce the memory footprint and vertex search time. We evaluate \SystemName by applying it to eight real-life
graph datasets on an NVIDIDA 2080Ti GPU. We compare \SystemName against GSI, the state-of-the-art GPU-based subgraph search framework.
Experimental results show that \SystemName consistently and significantly outperforms GSI on all test datasets. We also show that our
parallel vertex matching scheme delivers better performance than a variant that implements a single-vertex matching scheme but with our
enhanced storage format.
