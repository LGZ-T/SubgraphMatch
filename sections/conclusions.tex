In this work, we propose a double-vertex extension method to match query graphs in a labeled undirected data graph. Also, we improve the performance of hash-PCSR by replacing its hash indexes with interval indexes. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms GSI, which is the state-of-the-art subgraph matching method on GPU, in all tested data graphs. We also validate the effectiveness of double-vertex extension method by comparing it to the single-vertex extension method.
